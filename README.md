# WR_analysis

### Code written to analyse WR binaries for my MSc thesis work with dr. Tomer Shenar

#### Included:

Data:

- Light curve data on BAT99-32 obtained from ASAS-SN
- Radial velocities from BAT99-32 (not the actual velocities)
- Simulated polarization data

Code:

- LC_fit.py &rarr; Fits the light-curve data. Has separate option to plot reduced χ^2 as function of inclination.
- polarization_fit.py &rarr; Fits polarization data. Has separate option to plot reduced χ^2 as function of inclination.
- multi_fit.py &rarr; Fits light-curve, polarization and radial velocity data simultaneously. Has separate option to plot reduced χ^2 as function of inclination.
- gen_random_pol.py &rarr; Generate random polarization data of specified parameters. Used to test the polarization fit.
